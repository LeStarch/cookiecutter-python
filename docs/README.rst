This needs to be turned into proper documentation.

Python packaging is a mess. Pipenv PyPA's recommended solution. With Pipenv we still need to manage a setup.py file, so we will use PBR to manage it and for dependency consistency.  
Side note: Poetry may be something we consider in the future because of PEP 517 and 518.
